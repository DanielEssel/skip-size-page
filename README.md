# Skip Size Selector (Front-End React Challenge)

This project is a modern, responsive, and accessible redesign of the "Choose Your Skip Size" page for a skip hire web application. The goal was to demonstrate strong front-end skills, including clean React code, UI/UX improvements, and mobile-first responsiveness, based on a real-world technical challenge.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Approach

- **React Functional Components:** All UI built using functional components and hooks for state and effects.
- **Component Structure:**
  - `SkipSelectionPage`: Main container, handles data fetching, filtering, and selection logic.
  - `SkipCard`: Displays an individual skip, highlighting the selected one.
  - `FilterBar`: UI for filtering skip options by criteria.
  - `ProgressStepper`: Shows the booking progress.
- **Styling:** Built with Tailwind CSS (or CSS Modules), ensuring maintainable, scalable, and responsive styles.
- **Popup Selection Card:** When a skip is selected, a floating popup at the bottom displays skip details and an actionable "Continue" button. This ensures users never have to scroll to proceed.
